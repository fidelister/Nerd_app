                    <p>
                        As the world continues to shift toward digital solutions for most of our
                        everyday interactions, the need for on demand online tech support is
                        only increasing.
                    </p>
                    <div className="mt-2">
                        <p>
                            The <a href="#">old model of a separate IT Department </a> is starting
                            to prevent companies from being innovative, customer-focused and
                            digitally transformed because it hinders agile integration and
                            on-the-go solutions. Since the Covid-19 pandemic, more people are
                            working from home and the demand for fast, reliable and convenient IT
                            support has grown exponentially.

                    <p className="mb-2">
                        Online tech support apps like NerdApp are here to stay. They represent a
                        future-focused approach that allows people to access their tech support
                        in the same way they order a pizza, buy the latest fashion or hail a
                        ride.

                        Instead of being limited to the skills and services of a single IT team,
                        online tech support websites like Nerdapp allow users to find specialist
                        IT support technicians nearby or online that can assist with specific
                        issues across a wide spectrum - from physical computer repairs, and
                        device setups, peripheral setups to online troubleshooting, data
                        backups, cloud syncing, social media and website support, WIFI and
                        network support and even 3rd level support services such as systems,
                        security and networking - all on one platform.

                    <p>
                        For some people, being able to access on demand online tech support is
                        the most convenient way to solve their IT issues quickly and simply. For
                        others, having an IT support technician come to their home or business
                        and help them in person is far less intimidating and allows them to have
                        a more personal experience. They can discuss and demonstrate exactly
                        what they are struggling with. The ability to offer on-site IT support
                        also allows technicians to assist with more physical IT support issues
                        like hardware problems, device setups and peripheral support issues.

                        When you choose to use an online tech support app like Nerdapp for your
                        IT support needs, you are also gaining access to a network of highly
                        skilled and vetted experts in a wide range of IT support services. Every
                        nerd on Nerdapp has been carefully vetted to ensure users have a safe,
                        positive experience. Nerds are chosen for their unique skills and
                        experience they bring to the platform so that users can get access to
                        the widest range of support - whether it's a complex networking issue
                        for a business or a simple data transfer to a new laptop. Another
                        benefit of online tech support apps is that users can leave reviews for
                        their technicians and this allows other customers to clearly see a
                        record of their past work on the app and how well they were rated
                        according to their skill and customer service..

                    <h4 className="mt-2 mb-2">Business IT support or personal IT support</h4>
                    <p>
                        In the past, businesses had to rely heavily on overburdened IT
                        departments to solve their IT support issues, but that meant waiting
                        until someone became available and potentially not having the right
                        person for the job. Online tech support apps empower business owners to
                        choose when and how they get support and find the ideal candidate who
                        understands the <a href="#">most common IT problems businesses face </a>
                        and can help solve them. Businesses no longer have to spend days offline
                        or waiting for solutions. Instead, with an app like Nerdapp, they can
                        find someone to assist instantly!

                    <div className="mt-2">
                        For individual users, online tech support apps can take away the 'scary'
                        part of IT. Many people have no IT skills at all and are completely
                        overwhelmed when things go wrong. Others, like older people, may feel
                        out of touch with new technology and don't know where to start. But with
                        <a href="#">home tech support</a> options they can reach out instantly
                        for someone skilled and get a resolution before things become
                        overwhelming.

                        Why online tech support apps are more affordable
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        A dedicated IT department can work out costly for a business - with
                        salaries for each member of the team while at the same time not being
                        able to cover all IT service requirements. Choosing to switch to an
                        online IT support platform means that those costs are exponentially
                        reduced. Businesses can opt to pay upfront, pay-as-you-go or a monthly
                        subscription from as little as <a href="#">£230 for 5 hours </a> to
                        access on demand IT support from qualified technicians, rather than
                        paying for staff whose services aren't always required.
                    </p>
                    <div className="mt-2">
                        This cost-saving applies to individuals too. Because there are set rates
                        per hour for IT support technicians on apps like Nerdapp, you can manage
                        the costs according to your budget. Individual users can access on-site
                        tech support for as little as £48 an hour and get 15 minutes of online
                        tech support for £12!

                    <h4 className="mt-2 mb-2">Customer support for your IT support</h4>
                    <p>
                        When you are working with an IT Department or private IT support
                        contractor, there is often no recourse if something goes wrong. If the
                        technician fails in their task or there is a disagreement on any issue,
                        there is often nowhere to turn. When you use online tech support
                        platforms, you have access to customer support via the app or website
                        where you can reach out at any time and ask a question, make a complaint
                        or leave other feedback about your experience. This applies to both
                        customers and technicians, who have the benefit of support if they find
                        themselves in a position where they need it
                    </p>
                    <h4 className="mt-2 mb-2">Online tech support apps are the future</h4>
                    <p>
                        Technology is only getting smarter and so we will always need skilled
                        people to offer support when we are out of our depth. Choosing an online
                        IT support platform means opting to enjoy a convenient time and place
                        for support, access to highly skilled IT support specialists at your
                        fingertips and being able to manage your budget. For businesses or
                        individuals, online IT support apps like Nerdapp will become the
                        standard for IT support, as more people work remotely and the world
                        continues to become more tech-reliant and distributed.
